{"/":{"title":"In Tenant Struggle","content":"\nIn 2022, the Housing Justice Commission began a new project called [ETOC](notes/etoc), the Emergency Tenant Organizing Committee. Through this new project, we are facing many novel challenges as we support the growth of the US tenants movement.\n\nOrganizers often don’t leave enough documentation about their approach to work and difficulties they face. This blog is a place where 2023 Steering Committee members of the DSA Housing Justice Commission can share these ideas quickly. Enjoy, and we look forward to any feedback or questions!","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T01:56:08.12044968Z","tags":null},"/notes/etoc":{"title":"ETOC","content":"\nETOC stands for Emergency Tenant Organizing Committee. The purpose of ETOC is to create new autonomous tenant unions.\n\nETOC is part of the Housing Justice Commision (HJC), which is part of [DSA](https://www.dsausa.org/). The HJC implements [Resolution 21](https://convention2021.dsausa.org/2021-dsa-convention-resolutions/#P1U), which was voted on at a recent DSA Convention.\n\nETOC runs two training programs. The first one is a 2 Day intensive training that introduces tenant organizing at an intermediate level. The second one is a Mentorship program that pairs cohorts with experienced mentors who work through a 5-phase process of building a tenant union.\n\nETOC held its first 2 Day training in May 2022. In 2022, over 100 people from 17 DSA chapters were trained, and 6 cities were in active mentorship to create new ATUs, with another 4 in the process to begin mentorship.","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T01:56:08.124449735Z","tags":null},"/notes/why-etoc":{"title":"Why ETOC","content":"\nPeople have said nice things about their [ETOC](notes/etoc) experience.\n\n“The ETOC 2 Day Training is really good. After we first got trained we sent people who had missed it to subsequent trainings. I really recommend it.” - Ananth from [TCSD](https://tenantcouncilssandiego.org/)\n\n“Mentorship has helped us be less neurotic. Being able to bounce questions off folks with more experience and also getting that outside perspective has been so helpful. It's really allowed us to move forward.” - Ash from [TCSD](https://tenantcouncilssandiego.org/)\n\nBecause ETOC is run by experienced tenant organizers from across the US, and because ETOC is focused on creating new ATUs, cities who don’t yet have a tenant union can look to ETOC for support and guidance. \n\nWe keep track of what works in specific organizing contexts to share with future organizers, so joining ETOC is a great way to both join the broader tenants movement and contribute to it.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T01:56:08.124449735Z","tags":null}}
