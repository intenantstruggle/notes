{"/":{"title":"In Tenant Struggle","content":"\nIn 2022, DSA’s Housing Justice Commission began a new project called [ETOC](notes/etoc), the Emergency Tenant Organizing Committee. Through this new project, we are facing many novel challenges as we support the growth of the US tenants movement.\n\nOrganizers often don’t leave enough documentation about their approach to work and difficulties they face. This blog is a place where 2023 Steering Committee members of the DSA Housing Justice Commission can share these ideas quickly.\n\nPlease see notable posts below! :D\n\n**ETOC explainer for Mentorship cohorts to share with new TU members:**\n* [What is ETOC?](notes/etoc)\n* [Why join ETOC?](notes/why-join-etoc)\n* [My ATU and ETOC](notes/atus-x-etoc)\n* [Journey to Mentorship](notes/etoc-entrypoints)\n* [ETOC Curriculum](notes/etoc-curriculum)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-04T13:55:33.842432067Z","tags":null},"/notes/atus-x-etoc":{"title":"My ATU and ETOC","content":"So your ATU is/was part of ETOC’s Mentorship Program. What does this mean?\n\nYour ATU is connected to the larger tenants movement. An ETOC mentor has a relationship with your ATU, and will help answer any questions based on both their experience and a network of other tenant organizers. \n\nETOC’s goal is to develop strong tenant organizer leaders who can make decisions based on their understanding of their own local context. Although the [ETOC curriculum](etoc-curriculum) is specific and task-oriented, its basic orientation is to provide vetted options for new ATUs to start from, then iterate and evolve based on their own practice and local conditions.\n\nYour ATU is independent of [ETOC](notes/etoc), but we have a productive working relationship. We are bonded in solidarity as organized tenants seeking to end landlord exploitation. We also believe the tenants movement benefits from mutual exchange and knowledge sharing while supporting new ATUs when tenant organizers take on the role of ETOC mentor.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-04T13:55:33.842432067Z","tags":null},"/notes/etoc":{"title":"ETOC","content":"\nETOC stands for Emergency Tenant Organizing Committee. The purpose of ETOC is to create new autonomous tenant unions.\n\nETOC is part of the Housing Justice Commision (HJC), which is part of [DSA](https://www.dsausa.org/). The HJC implements [Resolution 21](https://convention2021.dsausa.org/2021-dsa-convention-resolutions/#P1U), which was voted on at a recent DSA Convention.\n\nETOC runs two training programs. The first one is a 2 Day intensive training that introduces tenant organizing at an intermediate level. The second one is a Mentorship program that pairs cohorts with experienced mentors who work through a 5-phase process of building a tenant union.\n\nETOC held its first 2 Day training in May 2022. In 2022, over 100 people from 17 DSA chapters were trained, and 6 cities were in active mentorship to create new ATUs, with another 4 in the process to begin mentorship.","lastmodified":"2023-02-04T13:55:33.842432067Z","tags":null},"/notes/etoc-curriculum":{"title":"ETOC Curriculum","content":"ETOC’s Mentorship Program has 5 Phases.\n\n**Phase 1: Pre-configuration** – consolidate working \u0026 process norms such as recurring meetings, socials, and how to onboard new members\n**Phase 2: Inquiry** – review popular outreach approaches, frame organizing convos that involve the law, and canvas as a tenant in your block or building\n**Phase 3: TU Skeleton** – minimal operations as a dues-collecting member organization with a public purpose and outward-facing materials \n**Phase 4: Fight** – conduct pressure campaigns against landlords as a mass organization where tenants lead their own struggle and not as a service org\n**Phase 5: TU Formation** – formalize decision-making procedures, define political line that unites multiple tendencies, and streamline procedures to enable new member involvement as TU grows\n\nBefore entering mentorship, we recommend groups [attend the 2 Day Training](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/join-the-emergency-tenant-organizing-committee/), which can help cohere a group’s commitment to building an ATU.

After we first got trained we sent people who had missed it to subsequent trainings. I really recommend it.”\u003e \n\n\\- Ananth from [TCSD](https://tenantcouncilssandiego.org/)\n\n\u003e “Mentorship has helped us be less neurotic. Being able to bounce questions off folks with more experience and also getting that outside perspective has been so helpful. It's really allowed us to move forward.” \u003e \n\n\\- Ash from [TCSD](https://tenantcouncilssandiego.org/)\n\nBecause ETOC is run by experienced tenant organizers from across the US, and because ETOC is focused on creating new ATUs, cities who don’t yet have a tenant union can look to ETOC for support and guidance. \n\nWe keep track of what works in specific organizing contexts to share with future organizers, so joining ETOC is a great way to both join the broader tenants movement and contribute to it.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-04T13:55:33.842432067Z","tags":null}}
