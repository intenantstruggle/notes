As long as you have 3+ core TU organizers and some observable commitment to building an ATU, then we let any group [join ETOC Mentorship](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/join-the-emergency-tenant-organizing-committee/). That said, we do have an onboarding flow that nearly every cohort passes through.

**Inreach / Outreach** - we give an ETOC presentation
**Intake** - we confirm your interest to attend ETOC trainings
**2 Day Training** - we do an intensive training (back-to-back 3-hour trainings) that covers deeper tenant organizing approaches and concerns
**Pre-pilot** - we support cohorts in the process of whether the mentorship pilot is right for them
**Mentorship Pilot** - we cover phases 1 and 2 of the [ETOC Curriculum](notes/etoc-curriculum) 5 Phase Program in 5 sessions over 2.5 months
**Mentorship** - we establish a formal mentor relationship with your cohort for phases 3-5
