ETOC’s Mentorship Program has 5 Phases.

**Phase 1: Pre-configuration** – consolidate working & process norms such as recurring meetings, socials, and how to onboard new members
**Phase 2: Inquiry** – review popular outreach approaches, frame organizing convos that involve the law, and canvas as a tenant in your block or building
**Phase 3: TU Skeleton** – minimal operations as a dues-collecting member organization with a public purpose and outward-facing materials 
**Phase 4: Fight** – conduct pressure campaigns against landlords as a mass organization where tenants lead their own struggle and not as a service org
**Phase 5: TU Formation** – formalize decision-making procedures, define political line that unites multiple tendencies, and streamline procedures to enable new member involvement as TU grows

Before entering mentorship, we recommend groups [attend the 2 Day Training](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/join-the-emergency-tenant-organizing-committee/), which can help cohere a group’s commitment to building an ATU. Some topics covered include:

* Tenant unions, councils, and associations
* Why build the tenant struggle?
* Landlord research
* Effective tenants meetings
* Common problems
* The role of fun
* Building the broader union
