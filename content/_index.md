In 2022, DSA’s Housing Justice Commission began a new project called [ETOC](notes/etoc), the Emergency Tenant Organizing Committee. Through this new project, we are facing many novel challenges as we support the growth of the US tenants movement.

Organizers often don’t leave enough documentation about their approach to work and difficulties they face. This blog is a place where 2023 Steering Committee members of the DSA Housing Justice Commission can share these ideas quickly.

Please see notable posts below! :D
